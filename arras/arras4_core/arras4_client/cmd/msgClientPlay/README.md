# msgClientPlay command

A standalone Arras client that can play back messages captured from a previous session. 
It differs from the **msgPlay** tool in *arras4_core_impl*, in that it takes the role of the session client and is used to play back outgoing messages captured from a real client.

Primarily used for testing/debugging.
